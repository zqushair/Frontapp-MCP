- Add more TypeScript compiler options like `noImplicitReturns` and `noUnusedLocals` for even stricter type checking
- Consider adding a script for database migrations if the application will use a database in the future

### Environment Configuration ✅

**Files reviewed:**
- src/config/index.ts

**Purpose:**
This file loads and validates environment variables, providing a centralized configuration for the application.

**Analysis:**
The configuration module is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns and validation of required environment variables. The module uses dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file and provides sensible defaults for optional variables.
